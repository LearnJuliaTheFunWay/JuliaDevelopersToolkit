This little book is the supplementary material of my next book [Learn Julia The
Fun Way](https://learnjuliathefunway.com/). The main goal of this book is to
help new Julia users setup development environment and learn how to explore and
build Julia packages. This online version together with the
[PDF](https://learnjuliathefunway.com/JuliaDevelopersToolkit/en/Julia_Developers_Toolkit_EN.pdf)
version are built with [Books.jl](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/Books.jl). You
can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/LearnJuliaTheFunWay/JuliaDevelopersToolkit).

If you find anything incorrect or would like to suggest improvements, it is
appreciated to file an issue
[here](https://github.com/LearnJuliaTheFunWay/JuliaDevelopersToolkit/issues).
