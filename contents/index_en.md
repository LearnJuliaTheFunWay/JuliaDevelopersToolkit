# Welcome {-}

This little book is the supplementary material of my next book [Learn Julia The
Fun Way](https://learnjuliathefunway.com/). The main goal is to help new Julia
users setup development environment and learn how to explore and build packages.
This book is built with [Books.jl](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/Books.jl). You
can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/LearnJuliaTheFunWay/JuliaDevelopersToolkit) and
download the PDF version [here](https://learnjuliathefunway.com/JuliaDevelopersToolkit/en/Julia_Developers_Toolkit.pdf).

If you find anything incorrect or would like to suggest improvements, it is
appreciated to file an issue
[here](https://github.com/LearnJuliaTheFunWay/JuliaDevelopersToolkit/issues).
